# Personal Site / Portfolio

===========================

## July31, 2022

### The project

This project is the first production version of my personal site / portfolio. Developed with HTML and CSS.

It consists in three simple pages: the home page, a links page for Instagram and a form page for estimate service prices; style with CSS file.

### Objectives

The website exhibits the services I provide as a freelancer so far, and tells a little bit about myself, my goals and how I try to aproach life. It also displays links for all my relevant social media and a simple scripted form, for contact direct from the website.

The most important feature is the portfolio section exibiting my projects, which is under development right now.

### Thoughts

I really like the results so far. I feel like the visuals are a fair representation of my state of mind right now. I'll be iterating this project the more my skills grow and develop.

I want it to be something that really grabs the attention and curiosity of possible recruiters in the long run. Hope I can get there!

##### OBS

The coding needs refactoring with more comments, specialy the CSS file; probably more clear classes and id's and more clean organization in the HTML sctructure.
